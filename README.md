 <h3>Iris Dataset:</h3>
<p> I have worked on iris dataset based GUI and also i  have uploaded data to the database system. we can get information about iris dataset in separate pop-up page.we can terminate main page also.</p>

 <h3> Corona Application: </h3>
   <p>we can get patient information that he is affected by corona virus or not. we have to know  some characteristics about patient
      <ul>
       <li> Body-Temperature</li>
       <li> Running-nose </li>
       <li> Breathing Problem </li>
       <li> Body-pain </li>
       </ul>
    from above characteristics, we know that patient is affected from corona virus or not.
<h3> Clustering </h3>
 <p> I am using k-means algorithm for clustering and dataset is taken from kaggle</p>
<h3> Linear Regression </h3>
 <p> i did linear regression algorithm on the dataset of Advertising is taken from kaggle </p>
<h3> Churn Dataset </h3>
<p> many of the <b>Telecom company</b> lose their customers from the different area such as less facility of voice plan, international plan comparing to others,some customers choose different telecom company etc.So that Telecom company loses their customer.Here, I have done experiment on that by using Machine Learning model.</p>
<h3>World Happiness Report </h3>
<p>you can see my blog: https://deepakgupta98.blogspot.com/2020/07/how-to-decide-happiness-ranking.html </p>
<h3>Rainfall Prediction</h3>
<p>Rainfall Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the amount of rainfall over a region. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures.</p>
<p>In this, we apply linear Regression to predict the how much inch will be fall.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Review </h3>
<p>we collect the feedback from the customers and apply which things should do for that Customer will come.</p>
